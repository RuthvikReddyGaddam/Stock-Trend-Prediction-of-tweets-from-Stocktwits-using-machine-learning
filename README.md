# StockTwits Tweet Analysis
## Overview
This project involves gathering records of nearly 10,000 tweets about Indian companies from StockTwits. Tweets were selected from the Banking and IT sectors, as well as tweets of market indices like Nifty50 and Bank Nifty. The data was then processed using Regular Expression and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform it into 300-size word vectors. An Artificial Neural Network with two hidden layers was developed, achieving an accuracy rate of 80% in predicting stock price trends of Indian companies. Additionally, predictions were made using additional tweets not included in the gathered dataset, also achieving an accuracy rate of 80%.
