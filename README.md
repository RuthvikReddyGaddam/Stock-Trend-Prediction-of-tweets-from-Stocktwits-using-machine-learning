# StockTwits Tweet Analysis
## Overview
This project involves gathering records of nearly 10,000 tweets about Indian companies from StockTwits. Tweets were selected from the Banking and IT sectors, as well as tweets of market indices like Nifty50 and Bank Nifty. The data was then processed using Regular Expression and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform it into 300-size word vectors. An Artificial Neural Network with two hidden layers was developed, achieving an accuracy rate of 80% in predicting stock price trends of Indian companies. Additionally, predictions were made using additional tweets not included in the gathered dataset, also achieving an accuracy rate of 80%. A research paper has been written detailing the findings of this project, which is currently awaiting publication.

## Key Steps and Technologies Used

### Data Gathering
Gathered nearly 10,000 tweets about Indian companies from StockTwits, focusing on the Banking and IT sectors, as well as market indices like Nifty50 and Bank Nifty
Data Processing: Utilized Regular Expression and NLP techniques to transform the tweet data into 300-size word vectors for analysis
Model Development: Developed an Artificial Neural Network with two hidden layers to analyze and predict stock price trends based on tweet data, achieving 80% accuracy
Prediction: Utilized the developed model to predict stock price trends of Indian companies using additional tweets not included in the gathered dataset, also achieving 80% accuracy
